# YWCC307 Individual Presentation

My Individual Presentation for Class YWCC 307 was on Reduced Intruction Set Computers. This are the microprocessor architecture that uses small and highly-optimized instructions rather than complex instructions.

The first RISC were introduced in late 70's by IBM, Stanford and UC-Berkeley. This type of microprocessor are commonly used in mobiles, gaming console, router and cars.
